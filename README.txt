Code for TFM Maximilian Fischer @ UCIV
######################################

The used code for the thesis is divided to each dataset. 

Datasets are MAYO, MtSINAI & ROSMAP

code with ending "*_final_max" was used for overall analysis of normalization, heatmap generation, hierachical clustering, GSVA and permutation. 

code with ending "_unannotated" was used to perform similar analysis as described above but without the functional category annotation. Hence code is adapted for this case. 

code named named "Braak_CERAD_analysis" was used to regress braak/cerad scores with ES. 

Custom R functions were previosuly used by the authors for annotation purposes and TAU calulation.
